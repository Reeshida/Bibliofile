						<h2>Reactions</h2>
						<p>At the time of its introduction the canvas element was met with mixed reactions from the web standards community. There have been arguments against Apple's decision to create a new proprietary element instead of supporting the SVG standard. There are other concerns about syntax e.g. the absence of a namespace.</p>

						<h2>Support</h2>
						<p>The element is currently supported by the latest versions of Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Safari, and Opera. It is not natively implemented by Internet Explorer (IE) as of version 8, though support is in development for Internet Explorer 9; however, many of the Canvas element's features can be supported in IE, for example by using Google or Mozilla plugins, JavaScript libraries and either Adobe Flash or IE's proprietary VML.</p>
